# Creating a README file for Employee Management System in Java with MySQL and JCalendar

# Employee Management System (EMS) - README

## Overview
The Employee Management System (EMS) is a Java-based application that allows organizations to manage their employee records efficiently. The system provides features such as adding, updating, and deleting employee information, as well as generating reports.

## Features
- Employee registration: Add new employees to the system.
- Employee details: View and update employee information.
- Search functionality: Search for employees based on various criteria.
- Reports: Generate reports on employee data.

## Technologies Used
- Java: The core programming language for building the application.
- MySQL: The database management system for storing employee data.
- JCalendar: A library for handling date-related operations.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Database Setup:**
   - Install MySQL on your system.
   - Create a new database named "employee_management".
   - Create the following tables:
     - `employees`: To store employee details (columns: `employee_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `hire_date`, etc.).
     - `departments`: To store department information (columns: `department_id`, `department_name`, etc.).
     - `salaries`: To store salary history (columns: `employee_id`, `salary`, `from_date`, `to_date`, etc.).

2. **Java Setup:**
   - Install Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system.
   - Create a new Java project in your preferred IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.).
   - Add the MySQL JDBC driver JAR file to your project's build path.

3. **Project Structure:**
   - Create the following packages:
     - `com.company.ems`: Main package for the EMS application.
     - `com.company.ems.model`: Contains Java classes representing employee, department, and salary entities.
     - `com.company.ems.dao`: Data access objects for database operations.
     - `com.company.ems.ui`: User interface components (Swing or JavaFX).
     - `com.company.ems.util`: Utility classes (e.g., date formatter, database connection).

4. **Database Connection:**
   - Use the MySQL JDBC driver to establish a connection to the database.
   - Store database credentials (username, password, URL) in a configuration file or as environment variables.

5. **UI Development:**
   - Create a user-friendly interface using Swing or JavaFX.
   - Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for employee data.

6. **Integrate JCalendar:**
   - Download the JCalendar JAR file and add it to your project's classpath.
   - Use JCalendar components (e.g., `JDateChooser`) for date selection.

7. **Testing and Deployment:**
   - Test the application thoroughly to ensure all features work correctly.
   - Package the application as a JAR file for distribution.
   - Provide clear instructions for end-users on how to run the application.

## Additional Notes
- Consider implementing authentication and authorization features to secure the application.
- Provide error handling and validation to handle edge cases.
- Document any additional features or customizations specific to your implementation.
